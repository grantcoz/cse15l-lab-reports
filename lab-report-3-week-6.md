- Create a file called config in the same place where you put the ssh key. Once the file is created type
````
Host ieng6
HostName ieng6.ucsd.edu
User cs15lsp22zzz (use your username)
````

- Once this is typed in your config file, try ``ssh ieng6`` and you should be able to sign in to the server.

- Now that you can sign in try copying a file by using typing ``scp (somefile) ieng6:~/`` sign in to the remote server and your file should be there.

## Setup Github Access from ieng6

 - Could not get this to work. Need help

## Group Choice 3 â€“ Copy Whole Directories with scp -r
